					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab was very straight forward and I was able to follow the tasks without much difficulty</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I always struggle with this problem but the syntax of my code was terrible and filled with mistakes which led to my button showing up but not working. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It was frustrating to deal with the different errors such as the missing semicolons and missing quotes but other than that I still believe that patience is a virtue.  </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
