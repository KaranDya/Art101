					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The lab was not challenging as I had an alright understanding of files and how they work within css and html.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One main problem that arose was that my committed changed would take time to appear on my website. The delay frustrated me and made me feel like I was wasting time.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I put a lot more energy in just finding my favourite pictures and making sure the website was atleast structured the way I liked it.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
