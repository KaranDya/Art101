			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I feel like though this lab was not challenging, it was more informative and let me learn about hwo the debugging tool worked</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Thewre were no porbles however i created some breakpoints for the bonus task of the lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> The debugger tool makes life easier and creates a digestable process to check your code for errors. I think its a more viable tool when you have thousands of line of code which would take forever to read over individually.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>Results can be seen below. </p>
