					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I think the lab was alright and not too challenging I had fun with seeing how the script would sort my name.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>my script was not working but that was because I did not have the correct code under my click function. Furthermore sometimes my buttons would not work due to spelling errors.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think within thiss assignmwnt I learned how to be patient with my code as it was not working due to my oversight and lack of attention. Once I took my time with the code I was able to spot the simple errors I had overlooked earlier. </p>
