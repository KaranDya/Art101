					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab was very challenging especially because working with the api's proved to be very confusing. At mutiple different points in time I would be met with various different errors.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My first problem was finding an api that would work on my webpage and my second main problem was getting that api to work within my page.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I think api's are useful tools which, if applied properly can be very useful in webdesign.</p>
