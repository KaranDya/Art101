			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenging part of this lab was to think of all the steps withnin the psuedocode.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There were no problems as Chad was really helpful in clearing up any problems I had on the lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think Pseudocoding is very interesting as it made me think about all the minute steps involved even in the most simple tasks.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<pre>//Psuedocode:
						//Print the board before each turn
						  //Loop through each row
							//Loop through each space
							//Print X, O, or space
						  //Print a new line at the end
						  //Print a horizontal line in between
						//Accept user input
						  //Ask user for input
						  //Proceed
						//Validate user move
						  //Make error message if move is invalid
						  //Proceed normally if not
						  //Update the board (Add users icon: O)
						//Evaluate possible moves
						  //Check columns if they have an empty space
						  //Mark columns with empty space valid
						//Choose computer move
						  //Choose valid move
						  //Update the board (Add computers icon: X)
						//Test for win or draw condition
						  //Win Condition: 4 icons are in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
						  //Draw Condition: No more possible moves, and win condition isnt reached.
