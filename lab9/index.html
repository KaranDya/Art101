					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was in making the button actually work. While my button would display and was clickable it did not change anything on my webpage.</p>

			<div class="minor-section" id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My buttons were not funtional, I think this was because my jquery was not loading correctly.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
