					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I think the challenge of this lab was in making sure jquery was loaded in correctly. I made sure to have the defer tag in the header and made sure all the correct files were linked in my header to ensure my site was not buggy.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Little problems arose during this lab for me. I wanted to have my buttons bordered which was a little tricky but webot waas able to help me out in making sure I had the correct code. </p>
