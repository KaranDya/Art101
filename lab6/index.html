			<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I think for me the challenge was understanding the difference between objects and variables. It took me some time to learn how to declare either and I would get constant errors because i nwould miss commas or other important punctuations.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For a while, i wasn't able to print the constant "MyMainRide" and it was becuase I was missing the commas at the end of each variable when defineing the object.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Through this assignment I was able to get a better understanding on how objects and variables interact in javascript. Furthermore I also learned about all the possible little errors that can happen if one is not attentive in their coding ventures. </p>
